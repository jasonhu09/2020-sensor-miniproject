## Ethan Hung and Jason Hu Sensor Project

**Task 0**

1. What is the greeting string issued by the server to the client upon first connecting?

The server greets the client with "IoT server starting:  localhost port 8765". The client greets us with "ECE Senior Capstone IoT simulator".

**Task 2**

1. What are the median and variance observed from the temperature data?

I choose lab1 for the room. The median of temperature in lab1 is 21.004 degrees and the variance is 4.791 degrees.

2. What are the median and variance observed from the occupancy data?

I choose lab1 for the room. The median of occupancy in lab 1 is 5.0 occupants and the variance is 4.765 occupants.


3. Plot the probability distribution function for each sensor type?

4. What is the mean and variance of the time interval of the sensor readings? Please plot its probability distribution function. Does it mimic a well-known distribution for connection intervals in large systems?

The mean of the time intervals between sensor readings is 0.996 seconds and the variance of the time intervals between sensor readings is 0.993 seconds.
The time intervals between sensor readings mimics an Erlang distribution, which is often used to model waiting times.

**Task 3**

1. implement an algorithm that detects anomalies in **temperature** sensor data. Print the percent of "bad" data points and determine the temperature median and variance with these bad data points discarded--the same room you did in Task 2 Question 1.


2. Does a persistent change in temperature always indicate a failed sensor?

A persistent change in temperature does not always indicate a failed sensor. The temperature readings can be affected by a variety of factors such as the air condition being turned on or a window being opened. This could cause a persistent change in temperature but this does not necessarily mean the sensor has failed.

3. What are possible bounds on temperature for each room type?

Since our algorithm defines an anomoly as a point falling outside the mean Â± 2 std, our bounds on temperature for each room type are given below.

office low:  17.668

office high: 27.960

class1 low:  5.601

class1 high:  48.042

lab1 low:  16.711

lab1 high:  25.466

**Task 4**

1. How is this simulation reflective of the real world?

2. How is this simulation deficient? What factors does it fail to account for?

3. How is the difficulty of initially using this Python websockets library as compared to a compiled language e.g. C++ websockets?

4. Would it be better to have the server poll the sensors, or the sensors reach out to the server when they have data?
