## Ethan Hung and Jason Hu Sensor Project 

**Task 0**
1. What is the greeting string issued by the server to the client upon first connecting?

The server greets the client with "IoT server starting:  localhost port 8765". The client greets us with "ECE Senior Capstone IoT simulator".

**Task 2**
1. What are the median and variance observed from the temperature data?

2. What are the median and variance observed from the occupancy data?

3. Plot the probability distribution function for each sensor type?

4. What is the mean and variance of the time interval of the sensor readings? Please plot its probability distribution function. Does it mimic a well-known distribution for connection intervals in large systems?

**Task 3**
1. Does a persistent change in temperature always indicate a failed sensor?

2. What are possible bounds on temperature for each room type?

**Task 4**
1. How is this simulation reflective of the real world?

2. How is this simulation deficient? What factors does it fail to account for?

3. How is the difficulty of initially using this Python websockets library as compared to a compiled language e.g. C++ websockets?

4. Would it be better to have the server poll the sensors, or the sensors reach out to the server when they have data?
